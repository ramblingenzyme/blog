<h1 class="title">My First Twitter bot</h1>
</div>
<p>For my first experience with NodeJS, I decided on the fairly popular project of a Twitter bot. All I had to do was figure out what this bot would tweet. I looked around for a while, and eventually I found out that my university offers a public API, which includes parking lot data.</p>
<p>So, I'd figured out my project: process the data from the API at intervals to tweet how many parking spots are open. I also thought having the bot tweet some grumpy things when the parking got full could be a fun little twist.</p>
<p>In the end I had to split the parking data into the 3 types of parking spot at UOW, ticketed, permit and carpool. Luckily collating all the data ended up being less than the 140 character limit of Twitter.</p>
<h2 id="first-experience-with-nodejs">First Experience with NodeJS</h2>
<p>Working with Node for a project really made me understand why it's such a popular language, and discover that the implementation of a module system made it a pleasure to work with.</p>
<p>With little/no understanding of asychronous programming, first class functions and callbacks left me confused and in the dark, with no idea what I was doing. This of course meant I had to research and understand these concepts if I was going to get anywhere.</p>
<p>However, once I understood these basics, after some research and structuring the program out on paper (as I probably should've done before starting...), progress came quickly.</p>
<p>In the end, I decided to use events to structure the program as it helped me split the program over multiple files with small functions with events gluing them together.</p>
<h2 id="npm-and-modules">NPM and modules</h2>
<p>A language with a package manager to make it easier to install specialised modules was a new experience for me. It seems to be a system with many upsides, but I can also think of quite a few situations in which it could complicate things.</p>
<p>In the end I only needed these three external modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aacerox/node-rest-client">node-rest-client</a>: To grab the parking data from my university's REST API.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mmckegg/json-query">json-query</a>: To query and filter the data returned into arrays.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ttezel/twit">twit</a>: To allow easy use of the Twitter API for &quot;publishing&quot; the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks for the effort and in-depth documentation from the creators of these modules, this wouldn't've been possible otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Node is a great language to work with</li>
<li>Modules are awesome and so are their creators</li>
<li>Good fun and experience</li>
<li>10/10 IGN would NodeJS again</li>
</ul>
<p>The bot is deployed on an AWS instance in Sydney, and can be found <a href="https://twitter.com/UOWParking">here</a>.</p>
