# `cat ~/usr/about-me.txt` #
I'm Satvik (ramblingenzyme), an undergrad CompSci student at UOW, born in the late 90's.
I enjoy programming and solving problems, and live most of my computing life in a terminal/shell.
Here is a list of words that describe me:

* Australian
* Linux geek
* Open Source admirer
* Tech enthusiast (with no money)
* PC Gamer
* Procrastinator
* Blogger (apparently)


# `cat ~/usr/about-blog.txt` #
This site is made up of markdown files with the HTML generated by [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) and automated by a small bash script shown below.
Of course this would need some refining, which would emerge over time as more posts are created and edge cases pop up.

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    for file in $(ls md/); do
        echo $file
        pandoc "./md/$file" -o "${file%%.*}.html"
            -c css/style.css
            -B include/navbar.html
            --title-prefix "Ramblings of an Enzyme"
    done
