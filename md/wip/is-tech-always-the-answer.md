title: 'The Tech Hammer. Or How I Learned to Love The Problem Solving'
---

# Introduction
As a computer science student, I not only noticed but am guilty of a tendency to want to throw software
or hardware at any number of problems.
At some point I noticed this "every problem is a nail" issue, particularly when discussing the shortcomings
of SOLS, the student dashboard system provided by my university. Specifically, the issue is when students
have to sign up for tutorials before the start of session.

# The problem
As it stands, the system provides an opening date, and a first come, first serve approach.
The issue with this solution is that their systems buckle under the load of a large number of students
attempting to all sign up at the same time. This ends up leading to load times of around a minute, where
afterwards the tutorial you want to enrol in, is taken.

This led to a heated discussion about how this issue could be solved.

## Short comings of this approach

## Potential solutions


* Fallacy of people involved in the tech industry to use software/hardware as a hammer
* Alternatives, solving for the user, rather than for the vendor
* Can you solve your problem with psychology?
